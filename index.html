        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Mehzad Muqadas, and I'm currently a double major in Computer Science and Neuroscience at the University of Lethbridge. I'm taking this course from my hometown of Lethbridge, and it's actually my first time taking a fully asynchronous class. While learning at my own pace is new to me, I think I have good time management skills and I'm excited to develop even more structure and independence through this experience.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Why I'm Taking This Course</h2>
        <p>I chose to take Contemporary Issues in Mental Health because I've always been fascinated by how deeply mental health affects every part of our lives — from daily functioning to long-term wellness. My studies have focused a lot on physical and brain-based health, but I want to learn more about how mental health impacts people in ways that aren't always visible or measurable. One of the courses I really enjoyed in the past was Loss, Grief, and Bereavement, which gave me a more human perspective on these experiences.</p>
        <p>Through this course, I hope to build on that foundation and better understand the complex systems, competing worldviews, and real-life impacts of how we define and treat mental illness. Since this course also explores how the mental health system is shaped by politics, pharmaceutical interests, and culture, I'm looking forward to challenging my own assumptions and learning to evaluate evidence more critically — especially with my neuroscience background.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Personal Connection to Mental Health</h2>
        <p>Mental health is also personally important to me. Like many students, I've had moments where I've felt overwhelmed by academic pressure and constant coursework. It taught me how important it is to check in with yourself and your friends, and to normalize taking breaks without guilt. I believe conversations around mental health in academic environments are still underrepresented, and I'd like to see more open dialogue and awareness on how performance culture impacts student wellbeing.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Time Management Plan</h2>
        <p>To stay on track during this course, I plan to treat it like my other summer classes by setting aside two focused blocks of 3 hours each week. One will be for engaging with weekly materials and assignments, and the other for reviewing, reflecting, and participating meaningfully in the forums. I also find that using time-blocking, keeping a separate digital calendar for deadlines, and starting assignments early helps me avoid last-minute stress and dive more deeply into the content.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I love problem-solving, especially when it comes to coding challenges and machine learning projects. Building models and experimenting with algorithms is something I genuinely enjoy — it's a rewarding mix of logic, creativity, and learning from mistakes. I also love reading, both fiction and nonfiction. One of my all-time favorite books is <em>When Breath Becomes Air</em> by Paul Kalanithi. I found it deeply moving because it explores the space between science and humanity, examining what it means to face mortality while pursuing meaning and purpose in life.</p>
